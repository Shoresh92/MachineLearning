    "## 2. Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the lecture notes, videos and artcles I read, I found the introduction to Naive Bayes on scikit-learn the most useful. Here is the [link](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html) to the page. For more extensive discussions, I suggest other books like [Baysian Data Analytics](http://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Analysis-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439840954/) recommneded in a post on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-books-for-learning-probability-and-statistics).\n",

    "To understand it however, I bring the definition of some of the key concepts from Wikipedia. \n",

    "1.  **Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation**\n",
    "MAP is a mode of the posterior distribution and can be used to obtain a point estimate of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data. MAP estimation can therefore be seen as a regularization of maximum likelihood estimation. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regularization**: \n",
    "in mathematics and statistics and particularly in the fields of machine learning and inverse problems, refers to a process of introducing additional information in order to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics))\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ** Maximum Likelihood **\n",
    "In general, for a fixed set of data and underlying statistical model, the method of maximum likelihood selects the set of values of the model parameters that maximizes the likelihood function. Intuitively, this maximizes the \"agreement\" of the selected model with the observed data, and for discrete random variables it indeed maximizes the probability of the observed data under the resulting distribution.
